The "Block Party" plugin for Omeka adds three new exhibit block layouts to
Omeka's Exhibit builder. These new block layouts allows you to include groups
of [exhibits](exhibits), [collections](collections), and [items](items) in your
exhibits. This plugin was created to support courses using Omeka, specifically
for courses where students write essays as exhibits based on materials already
in Omeka, so that all of the materials for such an assignment can easily be
gathered in one place.
