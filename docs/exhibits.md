The "Exhibit Group" layout allows for the selection of any number of exhibits
by tags or exhibit slugs. If both tags and exhibit slugs are used, only exhibits
which meet both selection criteria will be included.

Tag Query
---------
Use a single tag to include all exhibits with that tag in the block. Using
multiple tags, separated by commas, will select only those exhibits with
***all*** of the tags specified.

Slug Query
----------
Use slugs as identifiers to include specific exhibits in the block. You can
include multiple exhibits in this way by separating slugs with commas.
